# Q_simulator

Using the qutip library, simulate the TDSE on a initial state of a wavefunction.
The Hamiltonian of the SE is obtained from Oliver Quantum Engineer's Guide to SuperConducting Qubits, pg37

#Contents of each file
Hamiltonian.py - Contains the different Hamiltonian for different problems / gates
QB_simulator.py - Outputs the simulation results of a CR-gate qubit
Rabi_frequency.py - Outputs the difference in the rabi frequency for qubit 1 and 2 for a range of coupling and resonance frequency.
alpha.py - Outputs the rabi frequency of both qubits with the anharmonicity varying.
