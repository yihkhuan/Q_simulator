# Q_simulator

Using the qutip library, simulate the TDSE on a initial state of a wavefunction.

2. The Hamiltonian of the SE is obtained from Oliver Quantum Engineer's Guide to SuperConducting Qubits, pg37
3. Use the QB_simulator file to simulate the first or the second qubit, insert the parameters required in the hamiltonian
